My rcfiles collection
=====================

Thanks to pi314, now I used github to manage my rcfiles.

..  pi314: https://github.com/pi314

I am trying to make it portable on every UNIX-like machine (Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin, Mac OS X, etc.)

Installation
============

1.  ``git clone https://github.com/mozeroman/rcfiles.git .rcfiles``
2.  ``sh ~/.rcfiles/setup.sh``

Old rcfiles will be backed up, after these configuration file being installed, ``setup.sh`` will ask you if you want to install vim plugins.

Remember to change the user data in ``.gitconfig`` (or delete it)
