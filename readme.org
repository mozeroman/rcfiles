* My rcfiles collection 

  Thanks to [[https://github.com/pi314][pi314]] and friends in nba/nctu, now I use github to manage my rcfiles. The setup.sh copied from [[https://github.com/pi314/rcfiles][pi314 rcfiles]].

  A portable solution for UNIX-like machine (Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin, Mac OS X, etc.) and a reminder for everyone when to install a new system. 

  
* Other rcfiles I use

Those rcfiles are my favourites, people have higher understanding about tools they code. I cannot find any reason not to use those tools to make things easier when I do not have time to learn that much. I would install them before using my rcfiles.

  git as listed:
  
  - Prezto for zsh : https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto
  - Agonster Prompt for Prezto (optional) : https://github.com/mozeroman/zsh.prompts
  - Percol : https://github.com/mooz/percol  
  - Emacs : https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d
  - Fasd : https://github.com/clvv/fasd

  non-git plugins as listed:

  - Vimperator for firefox
  - devilspie for linux - window placement software (I use it at startup with .devilspie/startup.sh)
  - transset-df for transparent-window


* Installation

Download zip file from github or using the command below:

- For everyone:

  1. cd 
  2. git clone https://github.com/mozeroman/rcfiles.git .rcfiles
  3. sh ~/.rcfiles/setup.sh

- Or ssh way (note for myself):

  1. cd
  2. git clone git@github.com:mozeroman/rcfiles.git .rcfiles
  3. sh ~/.rcfiles/setup.sh

Old rcfiles will be backuped in ~/.old_rcfiles/ with timestamp, after these configuration file being installed. 

Remember to change the user data in .gitconfig (or delete it), to add/delete resource files.
